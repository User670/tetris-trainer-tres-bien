# A few words for you

*(This is not a faithful translation of the original Japanese - Teatube added a bunch of his own insights to it. Content marked "Teatube:" are added by Teatube.)*

**Congrats on graduating from Tetris Trainer Tres-Bien!**

Now that you have finished the Trainer, you should have decent understanding of T-Spins and twists of other pieces too.

Also, it would be great if you could use what you've learned in actual games!

We've learned many difficult tricks along the way, but you don't have to fully understand everything on the first go. (I also have problems with forecasting, digging and finessing. Honestly speaking it's impractical to be absolutely perfect.) At first you can start with the basics, and try some of the techniques near your Tetris wells and T slots. (Teatube: Most basic and most important, the technique of balancing!)

You can also learn a lot from watching other players play. You should have moments like "You can make a T-Spin here??" or "Wow that's some impressive recovery by spinning that piece", or something like that. Pay attention to the techniques as you watch pro players play. Sometimes you can even learn more from watching than playing.

It's also effective to review the techniques on other websites, or even dive into things not covered in this Trainer. (Teatube: TTT isn't complete too, you should be looking for other techniques on your own.)

Also, recent Tetris games often come with a Sprint mode (clear 40 lines as fast as possible). Trying to get faster time is a good practice for speed. Make use of Finesse to help precisely place pieces.

Finally, let's review what we've learned:

(Teatube:<br />
**Back to Back (BtB, B2B)**

If you clear an advanced line clear (Tetris or T-Spin), and your next line clear is also an advanced line clear, the latter will be a Back to Back.

*TL: misinformation removed here*<br />
)

**T-Spin Double (TSD)**

The main method of attacking. In high-level combats, it's arguable more important than Tetrises.

A TSD has the same attack power as a Tetris (4 lines of garbage, 5 lines if B2B), but a TSD only consumes two lines. That's a 20-block or 5-piece difference, which is a huge difference.

T-Spins are so important because of their speed and power.

**T-Spin Triple (TST)**

Base attack is 6 lines (7 if B2B, 8 if B2B on Tetris Online Poland). Scary power; can put your opponent in some serious pickle if you dump a TST at them while they are having a hard time digging. However, it's something hard to make from scratch, and will mess up the stack. You might make them if you are familiar with it, but it's probably not necessary to go for them from the start.

**Mini T-Spin Single**

Mini T-Spins are easy to do; you might as well casually get a few of those while digging. In Tetris DS (2006), Mini T-Spin Singles have an attack of 2 lines (3 if B2B), which is very powerful considering its difficulty.

However, in later games Minis hardly send anything at all. For example, in Puyo Puyo Tetris (2014), Mini T-Spin Singles send nothing normally, or 1 line when B2B. In the now-defunct Tetris Friend, Minis send nothing even when B2B (though you don't lose B2B when you clear a Mini).

So it's up to the situation whether you should go for a Mini.

(Teatube:<br />
**T-Spin Single (TSS)**

Many people don't care about TSS's because of their low attack power (2 lines, 3 if B2B). However, TSS is actually a quite efficient way to attack; after all, if you have B2B, clearing one line in a TSS gives 3 lines of attack. Appropriately using TSS can also provide the right terrain for later T-Spin setups or flattening out the stack. Quite useful.<br />
)

**Spins/Twists and Super Rotation System (SRS)**

After learning the Spins, I guess you had many oppotunities of spinning pieces into your stack. I added these into many of the puzzles because it's a very important technique.

But to be honest, the part where we had the most practice is the part with the S/Z (puzzle 15-1, etc). Even if we didn't have much practice on other twists, please still try to remember them in case they get useful for recovering your stack.

**Advanced techniques**

"Finesse", "Donation", "Forecasting" - these are tough skills, because they require you to make quick and complex judgements during combat.

For example, to perform finesse, you would have to decide where to place the pieces, recall the optimal button presses, then press the buttons. Even now I often make extra button presses in my games. Same goes for other skills. I wouldn't be suffering this much if I can foresee this far lol!

----

It's been a long time, but I'd be honored if this Trainer can be of help for you in your Tetris techniques. Make sure to practice more and improve your skills.

Props to you for getting it this far!
